    "### In this tutorial, we will go through the process for doing some analysis of an Excel file downloaded during the summer of 2018 from the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs (https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/requestlist/Pages/default.aspx) containing data on the licensure of Registered Nurses in the state at that time.  We will discuss select topics on the following things:\n",
    "- Data Cleaning (practice)\n",
    "- Exploratory Data Analysis (practice)\n",
    "- Mapping with Folium (practice)\n",
    "- Presenting Results & Data Coarsening (comments)\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the process, we will also discuss some observations resulting from performing these tasks and what insights can be gained from them.  In particular, we will consider the geographical distribution of Registered Nurses (RN) across the state of New Jersey, according to the data, and its impact on the availability of medical support at a given time, such as during an unexpected state of emergency.

From inspection of the column names and first 5 rows displayed above, it appears that each row consists of some very specific information of different data types, for an individual Registered Nurse.

We also note that some values may have been imputed, or provided by an analyst to replace a missing or invalid value.

The information indicates that there are many columns with null values since the number of non-null objects for a column is not always equal to 127,495 = the number of rows.  Additionally, values in the 'expiration_date' are given as datetime objects, although this is not the case for the 'issue_date' column where we already observed values of '1/1/1888'.  The other columns are most likely of string type, even when the values are numeric, but we can verify this as needed. The next step is to decide what values we need to \"clean\" in order to do our analysis.  "

Therefore, many of the columns with null or incomplete values will not play a role in our analysis, and therefore, we do not need to spend time cleaning these columns.

Let's check the number of unique values in this column and see if any have values with the first three characters varying from '26N' in the beginning or '00' at the end.

We also want to handle the strange issue dates such as '1/1/1888', '1/1/1901', or those with years well before the year 1950 (randomly chosen as a sensible date), suggesting that either these dates are unknown, in error, or that some very senior people are still licensed as RNs and have been practicting for at least 68 years, as of 2018!

A question that should arise, however, is why these rows have null values for the license issue date but others have the value of January 1, 1888 or contain the year 1901, or some other very early date which we assume was put there when an issue date was not provided for one reason or another; maybe because the issue date was prior to a time when this information was collected and compiled.  So what's the difference here?  Without verifying with the people who entered the info, we may never know.

Regarding other values, we will look for errors.  It can be difficult to determine whether any of the values in these address columns are invalid, but there are a few things we can check and/or standardize.  For example, if we later want to look at the distribution of the different values that show up in these categories, then we will need to make sure that different variations of one value do not show up as different ones.  We will capitalize some values for consistency and give only the correct spelling of the county name without the word 'county' in the value.

    "From the graph above, we see a trend that the number of actively licensed nurses decreases as we consider more years of experience, with a significantly high number of nurses who have either been practicing for more than about 66 years or whose tenure is unknown (since we standardized the data, imputing missing values with an issue date of January 1, 1950).  Based on the steady trend, we guess that this surprisingly high reported number of nurses with more than  of licensure 66 years is due to the standardization and not the actual fact.  On the other hand, this data could be more accurate than we think, considering the number of baby boomers who would possibly fit into this category. "

Further, excluding this group, we see that more nurses live in Bergen County than any other county, followed by a little more than half that amount in both Monmouth and Middlesex.

For this, we will need the longitude and latitude coordinates for georgraphical boundary points of each county.  We can get this information from a github resource (a JSON file) online located at *https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium/master/tests/us-counties.json* containing lots of information about every county in a state in the USA, grouped by state.  By reviewing the content, we determine that the 21 NJ county ID numbers are between 34001 and 34041, which will help us capture only this information and reducing our work, rather than going through the entire file of USA state counties.  The output of the code below (located with the help of Jason C. who the author thanks tremendously for his assistance) produces a dictionary we can use to access the 'id' numbers as a key to join information we have with county coordinates, etc. needed for graphing."

    "As data scientists, it is important to remember that we are usually not the Subject Matter Expert (SME) of the data; we should be experts at analyzing and garnering insight from the data.  Therefore, we must be very careful about drawing conclusions when sharing our results with the customers.  Doing the data analysis is just one step, although a major one, that should be taken during any decision-making process.  We want our customers to always be \"data-informed\" but very cautious about being \"data-driven\", as the data tells a story, but the story is almost always altered with the story *behind the data*.  The results we produced through EDA should be taken as insights and actually motivate further questions and investigations, that often can be explained with the SME's experience and hindsight.  So maybe instead of making recommendations to your customer on making decisions, make *comments* about what you observed and questions might be asked or examined. Explain the scope of your results, and always encourage your customer to gather other information to explain, support, or challenge the story that one might tell using the data. "

    "Another consideration that data scientists should take is privacy.  When presenting data and insights gained from analyzing it, it is important to determine what information should be make public and which should be protected.  This particular data set has lots of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) which many people would not want shared if it were theirs.  An ethical data scientist always keeps this in mind, whether there are policies in place or not about sharing information, and has to decide what information is appropriate to present when discussing results, whether orally or in writing.

This process simply takes information and makes it more generalized by specific enough to do analysis.  In this data set, there were columns that can be used without others to coarsen the data itself.  For example, instead of providing one's full address, we can provide the city and state, the county and state, or some other information.  Let's look at the columns we now have in our data frame.  "

    "Again, when determining what information we need and what to present, we always need to keep in mind the task at hand- what questions are we trying to answer and what information will help be get those answers?  In this tutorial, we were concerned about the RN residence distribution across the state.  This means that we needed some location data, which could be sensitive, especially for safety.  We ended up using only some of the columns we were provided, namely the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- issue_date\n",
    "- expiration_date\n",
    "- addr_state\n",
    "- addr_county\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used the 'gender' column to look at the distribution.  We could have used the 'addr_city' column if we wanted to map out or plot specific locations across the state, which would have been nice to do, but the data was too messy to clean and unnecessary for this tutorial.  Additionally, although we did not use it explicity, we can use th 'license_no' column since it provides unique identifiers rather than using the actual names of the RNs included in the data set.  For our research topic, this information was unnecessary but it could become important to the customer if it wants to actually contact any of them in response to any actionable results of our analysis based on their home locations.  With that said, let's create a dataframe with only the columns that we used and created that could be used for presentation purposes when discussing our results with clients and their stakeholders (or anyone else). We'll also order the columns in a useful way."
